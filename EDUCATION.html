                  <p>My education journey began in 2009 when I entered secondary school at SK Raub Jaya. These five years were filled with unforgettable memories and valuable lessons that shaped me into the person I am today. From 2015 to 2019, I continued my studies at SMK Mahmud Raub for my high school education. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience as I strived to excel academically while also actively participating in various extracurricular activities. In 2020, I pursued my diploma in Business Studies at UITM, where I gained knowledge and skills in the field of business. This paved the way for me to further my studies in a Bachelor of Business Administration (Hons) Marketing degree at UITM from 2023 to 2025. This degree program will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the competitive world of business. My education journey has been a fulfilling one, and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that have shaped my academic and personal growth.</p>
